# TikTok Upload Verification Guide 🎯

## How to Know if Your Uploads Worked (Beyond Checking TikTok)

Your content pipeline provides **multiple ways** to verify upload success, so you don't have to rely solely on checking your TikTok app!

---

## 🔍 Method 1: Upload Status Checker Script

Run this script to get a complete overview of your uploads:

```bash
node check-upload-status.js
```

**What it shows:**
- ✅ Number of successful uploads
- 📝 TikTok publish IDs for each post
- 📅 Exact upload timestamps
- 📄 Caption previews
- 🏷️ Hashtags used
- 🌐 Web interface status

---

## 🌐 Method 2: Web Interface Dashboard

1. **Start the web interface:**
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```

2. **Open in browser:** `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Check upload status:**
   - Go to "Account Management" section
   - Look for your account (@aestheticgirl3854)
   - Check "TikTok Status" - should show "Connected"
   - Use "Test Carousel Upload" button for immediate verification

---

## 📝 Method 3: Terminal/Console Logs

When you run uploads, you'll see detailed logs like:

```
✅ Carousel upload successful for @aestheticgirl3854
📝 Publish ID: publish_1234567890_abc123
📱 Status: draft
🖼️ Type: carousel
🖼️ Images: 3
📅 Uploaded: 2025-07-18T10:30:00.000Z
📄 Caption: Streetwear vibes for the weekend...
🏷️ Hashtags: #streetwear, #fashion, #style
```

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ "Carousel upload successful"
- 📝 Valid publish ID (starts with "publish_")
- 📱 Status shows "draft"
- 🖼️ Correct number of images

---

## 💾 Method 4: Database Verification

Your system automatically saves upload info to the database:

**Check the `generated_posts` table:**
- `platform_post_id`: TikTok publish ID (confirms upload)
- `posted_at`: Upload timestamp
- `status`: Upload status

**Database query example:**
```sql
SELECT account_username, platform_post_id, posted_at, caption 
FROM generated_posts 
WHERE platform_post_id IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY posted_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## 🔍 Method 5: TikTok API Status Check

Your system can verify uploads directly with TikTok's API:

**What it checks:**
- Post exists in TikTok's system
- Current status (draft, published, failed)
- Any error messages from TikTok

**How to use:**
- Built into the upload process
- Automatically runs after each upload
- Shows in web interface and logs

## 🚨 Common Upload Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No TikTok access token found"
**Solution:** Connect your TikTok account in the web interface

### Issue: "Token expired"
**Solution:** Reconnect your TikTok account (tokens expire after 24 hours)

### Issue: "Upload failed" with API error
**Solution:** Check if your account is added to TikTok Sandbox (for testing)

### Issue: Posts not appearing in TikTok drafts
**Solution:** 
1. Check the publish ID in logs

---

## 🎯 Quick Verification Checklist

After running an upload, verify these items:

## 💡 Pro Tips
