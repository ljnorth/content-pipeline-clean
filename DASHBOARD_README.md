# Content Pipeline Dashboard - Enhanced Stylistic Analysis

## üéØ Overview

The enhanced dashboard now provides comprehensive analysis of stylistic traits and their performance in your content pipeline. It extracts data from your existing `analysis` JSONB field and provides advanced filtering, trending analysis, and content generation capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run the Migration Script
First, you need to update your existing data to extract information from the `analysis` JSONB field:

1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to the **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `migrate-existing-data.sql`
4. Paste and run the script

This will:
- Extract `aesthetic`, `season`, `occasion`, `colors`, and `additional` data from your existing `analysis` JSONB
- Create optimized views for trending analysis
- Add performance scoring for each image

### 2. Start the Dashboard
```bash
npm run web
```

### 3. Access the Dashboard
Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`

## üìà Understanding the Data

### Why You Might See Fewer Results:

- If some posts don't have analysis data, they won't show up in filtered results

### Performance Metrics:
- **Trend Percentage**: Shows growth/decline over the last 7 days vs previous 7 days
- **Average Performance**: Weighted score combining engagement metrics
- **Average Engagement**: Pure engagement rate percentage
- **Average Likes/Views**: Raw engagement numbers

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing:
1. **Run the migration script** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Check your data**: Ensure you have posts with `analysis` JSONB data
3. **Verify the views**: Check if `stylistic_insights` and `trending_analysis` views exist

### Filter Not Working:
1. **Check field values**: Use the filter options to see available values
2. **Verify data types**: Ensure you're using the right operators for the field type
3. **Check for typos**: Field names are case-sensitive

### Performance Issues:
1. **Limit results**: Use smaller limits for large datasets
2. **Use specific filters**: More specific filters are faster than broad ones
