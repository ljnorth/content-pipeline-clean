# Project Structure Guide

## How to Explain Project Organization:
Think of your project like organizing a house:

### Folders are like rooms:
- Each folder has a specific purpose (like a kitchen is for cooking)
- Keep related things together (like all your clothes in a closet)
- Use clear names that tell you what's inside

### Files are like items in rooms:
- Each file has a job to do
- Name files clearly so you know what they do
- Put files in the right "room" (folder)

### Common folder structure:
```
project-name/
├── src/           (like the main living area - where your main work happens)
├── public/        (like a front porch - things everyone can see)
├── docs/          (like instruction manuals - explains how things work)
├── tests/         (like quality control - checks if things work right)
└── config/        (like settings on your phone - controls how things behave)
```

## When creating new projects:
1. Start with a clear main folder name
2. Create subfolders for different types of work
3. Keep similar files together
4. Use simple, descriptive names
