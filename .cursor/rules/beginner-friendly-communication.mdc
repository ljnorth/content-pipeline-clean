# Beginner-Friendly Communication Rule

The user is a beginner coder and needs all explanations at a 5th-grade level.

## Communication Guidelines:
1. **Use simple words** - Avoid technical jargon unless absolutely necessary
2. **Short sentences** - Keep explanations clear and easy to follow
3. **Step-by-step breakdown** - Break complex processes into numbered steps
4. **Explain the "why"** - Always explain why we're doing something, not just what
5. **Visual analogies** - Use everyday examples to explain technical concepts
6. **Ask for clarification** - If unsure about the user's understanding, ask questions
7. **Check understanding** - Periodically confirm the user follows along

## When explaining code:
- Compare code to everyday activities (like following a recipe)
- Explain each line like you're teaching someone to read
- Use simple analogies for complex concepts
- Break down file structures like organizing a filing cabinet
