# Error Handling and Debugging Guide

## Understanding Errors (Like Solving Puzzles):
When code doesn't work, it's like a puzzle with missing pieces. Here's how to solve it:

### Types of Errors:
1. **Syntax Errors** - Like spelling mistakes in writing
   - Missing punctuation (like forgetting a period)
   - Wrong brackets or parentheses
   - Typos in code words

2. **Logic Errors** - Like following a recipe wrong
   - Code runs but does the wrong thing
   - Like adding salt instead of sugar

3. **Runtime Errors** - Like trying to use a tool that's broken
   - Code tries to do something impossible
   - Like trying to open a file that doesn't exist

## How to Fix Errors:
1. **Read the error message** - It's like a clue in a mystery
2. **Look at the line number** - That's where the problem is
3. **Check the basics first** - Spelling, punctuation, brackets
4. **Test small pieces** - Fix one thing at a time
5. **Ask for help** - Don't get stuck for too long

## Debugging Tips:
- Use `console.log()` to see what's happening (like leaving breadcrumbs)
- Comment out parts to isolate the problem
- Work backwards from where the error happens
- Take breaks when frustrated

## When Helping with Errors:
- Explain what the error means in simple terms
- Show exactly where the problem is
- Explain why it happened
- Give step-by-step fix instructions
