# Coding Best Practices for Beginners

## Writing Code Like Writing a Story:
1. **Start with a plan** - Like writing an outline before writing a story
2. **Use clear names** - Name things like you're naming characters in a book
3. **Keep it simple** - One idea per line, like one sentence per thought
4. **Add comments** - Like footnotes in a book to explain tricky parts

## File Naming Rules:
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens: `my-file.js`
- No spaces in names (computers get confused by spaces)
- Use descriptive names that tell you what the file does

## Code Organization:
- Put related code together (like chapters in a book)
- Use indentation to show what belongs together
- Keep functions small and focused (like paragraphs in a story)

## When Writing Code:
1. **Think first** - What do you want the computer to do?
2. **Write it down** - Put your plan in comments
3. **Build step by step** - Add one piece at a time
4. **Test as you go** - Check if each piece works before adding more

## Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Don't copy code without understanding it
- Don't skip the planning step
- Don't forget to test your work
- Don't be afraid to ask questions
