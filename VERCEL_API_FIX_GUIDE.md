# Vercel API Fix Guide

## 🚨 The Problem

Your Vercel deployment at `easypost.fun` was returning HTML instead of JSON for API endpoints. This happened because:

1. **Vercel Serverless Functions vs Express.js**: Vercel expects individual serverless function files for each API route
2. **Single Express App**: Your `api/index.js` was a single Express.js application that Vercel couldn't properly route
3. **Route Conflicts**: API requests were falling through to the catch-all handler, returning the main HTML page

## 🔧 The Solution

I've refactored your API structure to work with Vercel's serverless function architecture:

### New File Structure:
```
api/
├── index.js                    # Main Express app (for web interface)
├── generated-posts.js          # Serverless function for /api/generated-posts
├── account-profiles.js         # Serverless function for /api/account-profiles
└── accounts/
    └── [username]/
        └── tiktok-status.js    # Serverless function for /api/accounts/[username]/tiktok-status
```

### What Changed:

1. **Individual Serverless Functions**: Each API endpoint now has its own `.js` file
2. **Proper Vercel Routing**: The `vercel.json` routes API requests to the correct serverless functions
3. **Database Integration**: Each function properly initializes the Supabase client
4. **CORS Handling**: Each function includes proper CORS headers

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel API routing with individual serverless functions"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
- Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Select your `easypost.fun` project
- Click "Deployments" → "Redeploy" on your latest deployment
- Wait for deployment to complete

### 3. Test the Fix
```bash
node test-vercel-api-fix.js
```

## ✅ Expected Results

After redeployment, your API endpoints should return JSON instead of HTML:

- ✅ `/api/generated-posts` → JSON array of posts
- ✅ `/api/account-profiles` → JSON array of profiles  
- ✅ `/api/accounts/[username]/tiktok-status` → JSON object with TikTok status
- ✅ Main page → HTML (unchanged)

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] API endpoints return JSON (not HTML)
- [ ] Database connectivity works
- [ ] TikTok status checks work
- [ ] Upload verification tools function
- [ ] Web interface remains accessible

## 🎯 How This Fixes Your TikTok Upload Verification

Now your upload verification system will work seamlessly on both:

1. **Local Development**: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Production**: `https://easypost.fun`

You can verify uploads using:
- Web interface dashboard
- API endpoints returning proper JSON
- Database queries
- TikTok API status checks

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** (commit, push, redeploy on Vercel)
2. **Test the API endpoints** using the test script
3. **Verify TikTok uploads** using the working API endpoints
4. **Monitor upload status** through the web interface

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:
1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Run the test script to identify specific problems
3. Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard

**Key Takeaway**: This fix transforms your single Express.js app into individual Vercel serverless functions, making your API endpoints properly accessible on your production deployment.
